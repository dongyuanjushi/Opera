# configure_docker_registry.sh — CLIENT-side config. Run this ON A WORKER (or a
# build host) to point its Docker daemon at the xrlenv registries, by merging
# `registry-mirrors` + `insecure-registries` into /etc/docker/daemon.json without
# clobbering existing keys (data-root etc.). Same merge pattern as
# set_docker_data_root.sh.
#
# It configures up to two things, each optional (set at least one):
#
#   MIRROR_URL=http://<host>:5010        the PROXY mirror (run-registry-mirror.sh).
#     Added to `registry-mirrors` (+ its host:port to `insecure-registries` for
#     plain HTTP). Applies ONLY to docker.io pulls; no image refs change; if the
#     mirror is down, dockerd falls back to Docker Hub automatically.
#
#   PRIVATE_REGISTRY=<host>:5011         the PRIVATE writable registry
#     (run-registry-private.sh). Added to `insecure-registries` only (NOT a mirror —
#     named refs like `<host>:5011/xrlenv-seta-env/0:main` are addressed directly).
#     Lets this host `docker push` to / `docker pull` from the private registry
#     over plain HTTP. Set this on build hosts (to push) and on workers (to pull).
#     A named-ref miss has NO Docker-Hub fallback, unlike a mirror miss.
#
#   SCRATCH_REGISTRY=<host>:5012         the SCRATCH build-on-demand registry
#     (run-registry-scratch.sh). Added to `insecure-registries` only, exactly
#     like PRIVATE_REGISTRY. Every node that runs scratch_build rollouts pushes
#     the on-demand-built image here / pulls it back, so ALL workers need it.
#
# It does NOT run a registry. The registry SERVERS are separate things
# (deploy/registry/run-registry-{mirror,private,scratch}.sh) that run on the
# control-plane box or a dedicated registry node — never on a worker.
#
# Idempotent + self-healing: re-running is a no-op once the config is live in the
# daemon, but it (re)loads a running daemon that has the config on disk yet never
# re-read it — so re-running fixes a node left in the "configured but not active"
# state.
#
# Usage (on each worker / build host, via sudo):
#   sudo MIRROR_URL=http://<registry-host>:5010 bash deploy/registry/configure_docker_registry.sh [--restart]
#   sudo PRIVATE_REGISTRY=<registry-host>:5011 bash deploy/registry/configure_docker_registry.sh [--restart]
#   sudo MIRROR_URL=http://<registry-host>:5010 PRIVATE_REGISTRY=<registry-host>:5011 \
#        SCRATCH_REGISTRY=<registry-host>:5012 \
#        bash deploy/registry/configure_docker_registry.sh [--restart]
#
# Applying the merged config is automatic and safe in both bootstrap directions:
#   * Docker not installed / not running yet (fresh node): the config is just
#     written; dockerd reads it on its FIRST start. Nothing is (re)started.
#   * Docker already running (re-bootstrap, or a node with Docker up): the merge
#     is applied LIVE via `systemctl reload docker` — registry-mirrors and
#     insecure-registries are SIGHUP-reloadable — so no containers bounce and the
#     node agent keeps its daemon connection.
#   * --restart: force a full `systemctl restart docker` instead of the live
#     reload (also applies non-reloadable keys, e.g. a same-pass data-root
#     change), then restart xrlenv-node, which the restart disconnects.
