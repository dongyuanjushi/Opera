# Build-once-ship-many image distribution recipe.
#
# Operator-facing recipe for the deployment topology where:
#
#   - One "builder" host runs `build-task-images.sh` and produces
#     the per-task images locally (`<bench>/<task>:0.1`).
#   - Multiple "receiver" nodes need the same bytes but cannot
#     reach a registry (corporate firewall, air-gapped cluster,
#     no shared registry yet).
#
# The script `docker save`s each tag on the builder, scp's the
# tarball to each receiver, and `docker load`s it. Every node ends
# up with byte-identical bytes (content-addressed save+load is
# faithful), but no registry digest exists — the corresponding
# manifest must declare ``image_pin_mode: per_node_local`` so the
# catalog skips central pinning.
#
# This is the minimum-viable shell-script form; a polished CLI wrapper
# (`xrlenv images ship ...`) may follow.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy/ship-images.sh --tags '<bench>/<task1>:0.1 <bench>/<task2>:0.1' \
#                           --receivers user@host1.example.com,user@host2.example.com
#
# Optional flags:
#   --tag-file <path>        Read tags from a file (one per line) instead
#                            of --tags.
#   --concurrency <n>        Parallel ship jobs (default 4; positive int).
#   --tarball-dir <dir>      Where to stage the .tar files on the
#                            builder (default $TMPDIR or /tmp).
#   --dry-run                Print the ssh/scp commands without
#                            running them.
#
# Audit response (L1 hardening, 2026-05-02): all command
# execution goes through ``run_cmd`` which takes argv as an array
# and never invokes ``eval``. Operator-supplied tags / paths /
# receivers can therefore contain shell metacharacters without
# breaking quoting or executing unintended shell. A ``%q``-quoted
# remote command is the one place where shell expansion is
# necessary (the ssh remote runs in a shell on the receiver), and
# the values that flow into it are first sanitised through
# ``printf %q`` before composition.
