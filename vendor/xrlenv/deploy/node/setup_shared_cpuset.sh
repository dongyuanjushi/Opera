# setup_shared_cpuset.sh — (re)establish the delegated CPU-isolation shared-parent cpuset
# cgroup ``/sys/fs/cgroup/xrlenv-shared`` for the NON-ROOT node agent.
#
# Idempotent + no-op-safe. Called by:
#   * deploy/node/enable_cpu_isolation.sh, once the container probe has proven the
#     node honors cgroup_parent cpuset propagation, and
#   * the ``xrlenv-cpu-isolation.service`` systemd oneshot AT BOOT — because
#     cgroups do NOT survive a reboot, so ``xrlenv-shared`` + its chown-delegation
#     must be recreated after docker is up and BEFORE the agent starts, or the
#     node reverts to non-capable until a redeploy re-runs the enable script.
#
# Does NOTHING unless docker is on the ``cgroupfs`` cgroup driver (the CPU-isolation gate),
# so it's safe to leave the boot unit enabled on a node later reverted to
# systemd-driver. Never flips the driver, runs the probe, or restarts anything —
# it only creates + delegates the cgroup (the one privileged step the non-root
# agent cannot do for itself).
#
# Env knobs: CGROUP_ROOT (default /sys/fs/cgroup), AGENT_USER (default: the
# xrlenv-node unit's User=, else ``xrlenv``).
