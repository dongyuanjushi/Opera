# The Deep Learning AMI ships ~41 GB of CUDA toolkits under /usr/local/
# that are useless on CPU instances (m7i, c7i, etc.). Removing them
# frees local root disk for containerd staging during image pulls.
#
# Usage (on each CPU node, via sudo):
#   sudo bash /path/to/xrlenv/deploy/node/cleanup_cuda_cpu_node.sh
