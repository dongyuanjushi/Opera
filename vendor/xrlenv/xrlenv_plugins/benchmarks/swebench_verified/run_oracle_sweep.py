"""run_oracle_sweep.py — the SWE-bench Verified correctness gate.

Drives the **upstream** swebench harness (``run_instance`` + ``get_eval_report``)
against the xrlenv cluster via the **docker-py drop-in** — the only xrlenv-specific
line is ``client = xrlenv.from_env()`` (``--local`` uses ``docker.from_env()`` for a
baseline). This is NOT the harbor/pier ``import_path`` shape: swebench has its own
harness that speaks docker-py, so we swap the docker client and let the harness run
unmodified (GUIDELINE §7.1 / the docker-py-drop-in path).

Oracle policy: each instance's prediction is the **dataset's gold patch**, read from
the cache (``build_cache.py`` materialized ``<cache>/swebench-verified/<id>/``). The
harness applies it + runs the per-repo tests + writes ``report.json`` with
``resolved: true/false`` (upstream's own field — we never invent a resolution rule).
Every gold-patch-as-prediction should resolve; a non-resolving instance under the
oracle is a plumbing/content bug, not a model signal.

Contract (GUIDELINE §3.3): reads instances from the cache (fail loud if unpopulated),
requires ``XRLENV_GRPC_HOST`` in cluster mode, exit 0 iff **every** instance resolved,
per-run ``summary.json`` under ``<jobs-dir>/<job-id>/``. Two retry layers live HERE, in this
driver (the shell wrapper only forwards their flags): ``--retries`` re-runs a trial on
INFRA-transient errors ONLY, and ``--content-retries`` re-runs an UNRESOLVED instance to
distinguish a one-off flake from a real regression.

Usage::

    # 8-instance smoke on the cluster (env-var-driven):
    python xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/swebench_verified/run_oracle_sweep.py --smoke
    # a subset:
    python .../run_oracle_sweep.py --tasks django__django-11099,sympy__sympy-13615
