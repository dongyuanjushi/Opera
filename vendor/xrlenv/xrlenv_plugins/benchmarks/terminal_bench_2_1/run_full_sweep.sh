#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run_full_sweep.sh — launch the terminal-bench-2-1 "green" oracle sweep.
#
# The green set = all present tasks MINUS the EXCLUDE list below (operational
# excludes only — NOT broken oracles). Right now that is 89 present − 1 excluded
# (caffe-cifar-10, whose dataset host is very slow) = 88. Runs the patched oracle
# against the shared harbor cache and reports which tasks reward > 0. An oracle
# FAIL here is a corpus defect (reward ceiling 0 → poison for RL), usually an
# unpinned dependency that drifted — inspect the per-trial verifier output and add
# a pin to build_cache.py's PATCHES table.
#
# Unlike TerminalWorld, tb2.1 tasks carry their OWN ``docker_image`` in task.toml
# (path-source / LocalTaskId), so there is no registry-image-template to export —
# the cluster pulls each task's image on first acquire.
#
# Typical use (after removing the cache dir to force a clean rebuild):
#     rm -rf "$XRLENV_BENCHMARK_CACHE/terminal-bench-2-1"
#     bash xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/terminal_bench_2_1/run_full_sweep.sh
#
# This script:
#   1. (re)builds the cache with `build_cache.py --stage all` — populate (registry
#      pull, if the shard is empty) + patch (dependency pins on marker-flagged
#      tasks). Idempotent: if already populated it just re-applies the pins (fast).
#   2. computes the green set = present tasks − EXCLUDE (asserts 89 present / 88
#      green), and
#   3. runs `run_oracle_sweep.py` over them.
#
# Flags (the interface — run knobs are FLAGS, not env vars: a stale exported
# SKIP_BUILD/LIST_GREEN must never silently turn a real sweep into a no-op.
# XRLENV_* deployment config still comes from .env):
#   --max-workers N       trial concurrency (default: 32). tb2.1 is all-runc (no
#                         sysbox cap), so this can go high (64 per the README);
#                         xrlenv's fail-fast+retry absorbs any create-time capacity
#                         pressure at high concurrency.
#   --content-retries N   re-run non-passing tasks up to N times (default: 0)
#   --job-id LABEL        run label under tmp/ (default: tb21-full-sweep; ts appended)
#   --jobs-dir DIR        per-trial artifact root (default: ./tmp/sanity-checks)
#   --skip-build-cache    skip step 1 (cache already built this session)
#   --list-green          print the green set (present − EXCLUDE) and exit
#   <anything else>       forwarded to run_oracle_sweep.py (e.g. --timeout-multiplier 1.5 --cpu-pinning)
# XRLENV_BENCHMARK_CACHE (cache ROOT) still comes from the env / .env.
