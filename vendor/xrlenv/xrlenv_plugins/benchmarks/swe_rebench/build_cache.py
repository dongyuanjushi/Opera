"""Build a shared harbor task cache for the SWE-rebench leaderboard benchmark.

Self-contained pipeline, mirroring ``frontier_swe/build_cache.py`` in shape
(``--stage`` driven, idempotent), retargeted at **SWE-rebench** — a
harbor-format task corpus published as a **Harbor Hub package dataset**
(``swe-rebench/swe-rebench-leaderboard``, 860 curated Python SWE tasks from
Nebius AI R&D). Each task unpacks to ``task.toml`` + ``instruction.md`` +
``environment/Dockerfile`` + ``tests/{test.sh,parser.py,config.json}`` +
``solution/solve.sh`` — the exact harbor filesystem contract
``TaskConfig(path=…)`` consumes. All 860 ship a reference solution, so the
whole corpus is oracle-gateable.

Stages
------
    populate  Download the dataset from the Harbor Hub into
              ``<dest>/swe-rebench/<task_id>/`` and normalize each
              ``task.toml``. Needs network (anonymous — the dataset is
              public); no git clone, no HF token.
    repin     Write each task's authoritative prebuilt image into its
              ``task.toml`` as ``[environment] docker_image``. See
              "Why repin" below.
    patch     Apply the curated content fixes, of two kinds: full-file
              ``patches/<id>/`` overlays (starts EMPTY), and programmatic
              ``task.toml`` edits — resource routing (``XRLENV_CPU_PINNING``
              markers + fair memory overrides, :data:`CPU_PINNING_TASKS` /
              :data:`MEMORY_OVERRIDES`) and hermeticity env
              (:data:`HERMETICITY_ENV`). Same two-kind split
              terminal_bench_2_1 uses (its ``PATCHES`` + ``ENV_PATCHES``).
    all       populate (only if missing) -> repin -> patch. The default.

Why repin
---------
SWE-rebench tasks carry **no** ``[environment] docker_image``. Upstream ships a
prebuilt image per task on Docker Hub (``swerebench/sweb.eval.x86_64.<slug>``)
and expresses it as the ``FROM`` of a three-line ``environment/Dockerfile``
that adds ``ENV _JAVA_OPTIONS=""``, an ``uv`` install, and ``mkdir -p /logs``.
The xrlenv harbor cluster environment resolves an image ref at acquire; it does
not build on acquire. So ``--stage repin`` writes the authoritative upstream ref
into ``task.toml``, turning the whole corpus into a pull-on-demand
``type: registry`` plan with **nothing to build**.

The ref is read from the task's own ``tests/config.json`` (upstream's declared
``docker_image``) and **cross-checked against the Dockerfile's ``FROM``** — a
mismatch fails loud rather than silently pinning the wrong image.

What repinning drops, and why it is safe
----------------------------------------
Two of the Dockerfile's three lines are provably inert under harbor 0.20:

* ``RUN mkdir -p /logs`` — harbor creates the log tree itself. Its
  ``empty_dirs`` (``harbor/environments/base.py``) runs
  ``mkdir -p /logs/verifier && chmod 777`` in-container before the verifier
  phase, and every one of the 860 ``tests/test.sh`` opens with its own
  ``mkdir -p /logs/verifier``.
* ``ENV _JAVA_OPTIONS=""`` — a guard against a JVM echoing
  ``Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS`` into parsed test output. No task's ``test.sh``
  or ``solve.sh`` references it, and no base image sets it.
* the ``uv`` install — **the base images already ship uv.** 17 tasks' verifiers
  run ``uv run pytest`` / ``uv pip install``; all 17 were run on-cluster against
  the plain upstream image with nothing built (2026-09-01) and 16 solved, the
  17th failing on an unrelated upstream packaging defect. No trial produced
  ``uv: command not found``, and passing trials show uv working from
  ``/root/.cache/uv/``. See STATUS.md.
