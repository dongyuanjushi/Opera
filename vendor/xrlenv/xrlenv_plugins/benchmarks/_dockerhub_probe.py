"""Docker Hub size-probe helper shared by per-benchmark plan generators.

Per-benchmark build-plan generators under ``xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/``
probe Docker Hub's v2 manifest API to learn each image's compressed
layer size so the FFD bin-packer reserves a realistic amount of disk
per entry. Two failure modes bit operators previously and are the
reason this helper exists:

1. **Rate limits.** Unauthenticated requests against
   ``hub.docker.com/v2`` are throttled at ~100 / 6 h per source IP.
   A 500-instance ``--all`` run blows through the budget around entry
   #100; every subsequent probe silently falls back to the
   generator's conservative default size_hint (typically much larger
   than reality), which over-reserves disk in FFD and rejects the
   plan at apply time.
2. **No visibility.** The old probe path returned ``None`` on every
   failure and the generator quietly used the heuristic. Operators
   only learned something was wrong 30 min later when
   ``xrlenv build apply`` reported ``InsufficientCapacity`` against
   an apparently-reasonable plan.

This module fixes both:

- ``probe_image_size`` accepts a Docker Hub Personal Access Token
  via ``DOCKERHUB_USER`` + ``DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`` env vars. When set,
  the helper exchanges them for a JWT once and attaches
  ``Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`` to every probe. Business / Team
  / Pro accounts get their plan's higher (or unlimited) rate cap.
- ``probe_image_size`` increments a process-wide counter on each
  call. ``announce_auth_status`` prints a banner before the loop so
  operators know whether the run is authenticated. The first
  failure surfaces a loud stderr warning with the HTTP status and
  response body so operators see *immediately* that fallbacks have
  started. ``print_probe_summary`` prints final stats — fall back
  count, suspected cause — so the operator knows whether to trust
  the size hints or set ``DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`` and re-run.

The helper is stdlib-only and re-entrant: tests call
``reset_probe_state()`` between cases to clear the JWT cache + stats.

**Thread-safety.** ``probe_image_size`` is safe to call from multiple
threads concurrently. The JWT exchange is guarded by a double-checked
lock so concurrent first-callers exchange exactly once, and every
mutation of the ``_STATS`` counters + ``_FIRST_FAILURE_REPORTED``
flag is performed under ``_STATS_LOCK``. The generator's
``--max-workers`` driver chooses the pool size; the helper just
honors whatever is asked. (This is consistent with the project rule
that concurrency policy lives at the driver level — xrlenv core
carries no locks; this is a driver-side helper under
``xrlenv_plugins/``.)
