# run_full_sweep.sh — launch the TerminalWorld "green" oracle sweep (187 tasks).
#
# The 187 = all 200 verified tasks MINUS the 13 that can't pass (12 Failed —
# incl. tw_528959's unreasonable timeout — + 1 need-investigation tw_222108,
# per STATUS.md; tw_245032 fixed 2026-07-08). Runs the pinned oracle against the shared
# harbor cache and reports which tasks reward 1.0.
#
# Typical use (after removing the cache dir to force a clean rebuild):
#     rm -rf "$XRLENV_BENCHMARK_CACHE/terminalworld-verified"
#     bash xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/terminalworld/run_full_sweep.sh
#
# This script:
#   1. (re)builds the cache with `build_cache.py --stage all` — populate (HF
#      download, if the shard is empty) + patch (+cpu-pinning) + sysbox markers.
#      Idempotent: if already populated it just re-applies the overlays (fast).
#   2. computes the green set = present tasks - EXCLUDE (asserts it is 191), and
#   3. runs `run_oracle_sweep.py` over them.
#
# Flags (the interface — run knobs are FLAGS, not env vars: a stale exported
# SKIP_BUILD/LIST_GREEN must never silently turn a real sweep into a no-op.
# XRLENV_* deployment config still comes from .env):
#   --max-workers N       trial concurrency (default: 32)
#   --content-retries N   re-run non-passing tasks up to N times (default: 0)
#   --job-id LABEL        run label under tmp/ (default: tw-full-sweep; ts appended)
#   --jobs-dir DIR        per-trial artifact root (default: ./tmp/sanity-checks)
#   --skip-build-cache    skip step 1 (cache already built this session)
#   --list-green          print the green set (present − EXCLUDE) and exit
#   <anything else>       forwarded to run_oracle_sweep.py (e.g. --timeout-multiplier 1.5 --retries 1)
# XRLENV_BENCHMARK_CACHE (cache ROOT) still comes from the env / .env.
