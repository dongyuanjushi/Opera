"""Run the benchmark suite described by ``xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/tests/integration/benchmarks.yaml``.

    python xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/tests/integration/run_benchmarks.py --profile full   # whole green set per benchmark
    python xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/tests/integration/run_benchmarks.py --profile ci     # a deterministic k-task sample
    python xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/tests/integration/run_benchmarks.py --profile ci --benchmark lhtb,seta --dry-run

This is the benchmark-onboarding integration harness: a config-driven runner over
the ``run_full_sweep.sh`` / ``run_oracle_sweep.py`` sweep contract, launched by
hand for a full green-set sweep or with a small deterministic sample for CI.

Two modes, both running ONLY ``present - EXCLUDE`` (each benchmark's own
``run_full_sweep.sh`` owns its EXCLUDE / blacklist — the single source of
known-failing tasks):

* ``full``   -> the benchmark's ``run_full_sweep.sh`` over its whole GREEN SET
  (present - EXCLUDE — never all present tasks), with its content-retry layer.
* ``sample`` -> read the green set via ``run_full_sweep.sh --list-green``, pick ``k``
  tasks DETERMINISTICALLY (seeded — same set every run; change the seed to rotate),
  then ``run_oracle_sweep.py --tasks <sample>``.

Exit code is 0 iff every selected benchmark's sweep passed, so this is CI-usable.
Covers the 5 harbor/pier benchmarks + swebench_verified (a docker-py drop-in that
now shares the same sweep contract). evoclaw + webarena-infinity have bespoke
entrypoints and are run manually.
