"""Shared resolver + hard guard for the benchmark task-cache root.

Lives with the benchmarks (``xrlenv`` core is deliberately benchmark-agnostic — it manages
containers/images, not corpora). Every golden-path benchmark's ``build_cache`` /
``run_oracle_sweep`` / ``build_plan_gen`` routes its cache-root resolution through here.

**Renamed 2026-07-31.** The env var ``XRLENV_HARBOR_CACHE`` -> ``XRLENV_BENCHMARK_CACHE``, and
the cache path's ``xrlenv_harbor_cache`` basename -> ``xrlenv_benchmark_cache`` (one shared
cache serves every benchmark; the "harbor" name was misleading now that non-harbor benchmarks
share it).

The OLD var and OLD path are **hard-rejected** — a downstream user still pointing at the retired
cache would silently read stale/absent data and get **unreliable results**, so every benchmark
entrypoint fails loud and tells them to migrate rather than run against the wrong cache.
