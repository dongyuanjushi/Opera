# run_full_sweep.sh — launch the frontier-swe "green" oracle sweep.
#
# The green set = all ORACLE-GATEABLE present tasks (those shipping
# solution/solve.sh) MINUS the EXCLUDE list below. FrontierSWE is a live
# leaderboard, so upstream withholds the reference solution for 6 corpus tasks —
# those ship NO solution/solve.sh and are therefore never discovered here (they
# cannot be oracle-gated at all). Of the 11 tasks that DO ship a solve.sh, 4 are
# GPU tasks the CPU-only dev cluster can't run, so they are EXCLUDEd — leaving a
# green set of 7. An oracle FAIL here is a corpus/plumbing defect (reward ceiling
# 0 -> poison for RL), not a model signal.
#
# FrontierSWE tasks carry their OWN prebuilt public-GHCR docker_image in task.toml,
# so there is no registry-image-template to export — the cluster pulls each task's
# image on first acquire (or a warm plan pre-pulls it; see build_plan_gen.py).
#
# Typical use (after removing the cache dir to force a clean rebuild):
#     rm -rf "$XRLENV_BENCHMARK_CACHE/frontier-swe"
#     bash xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/frontier_swe/run_full_sweep.sh
#
# This script:
#   1. (re)builds the cache with `build_cache.py --stage all` (populate git clone,
#      if the shard is empty, + patch). Idempotent.
#   2. computes the green set = present oracle-gateable tasks − EXCLUDE (asserts 11
#      present / 7 green), and
#   3. runs `run_oracle_sweep.py` over them (which owns BOTH retry layers).
#
# Flags (run knobs are FLAGS, not env vars — a stale exported SKIP_BUILD/LIST_GREEN
# must never silently turn a real sweep into a no-op. XRLENV_* deployment config
# still comes from .env):
#   --max-workers N       trial concurrency (default: 8). FrontierSWE tasks are
#                         heavy (up to 128GB/16cpu) and long (oracle ~1-2h), so
#                         the default is conservative; xrlenv's fail-fast+retry
#                         absorbs create-time capacity pressure at higher values.
#   --content-retries N   re-run non-passing tasks up to N times (default: 2)
#   --job-id LABEL        run label under tmp/ (default: frontier-swe-full-sweep; ts appended)
#   --jobs-dir DIR        per-trial artifact root (default: ./tmp/sanity-checks)
#   --skip-build-cache    skip step 1 (cache already built this session)
#   --list-green          print the green set (present − EXCLUDE) and exit
#   <anything else>       forwarded to run_oracle_sweep.py (e.g. --timeout-multiplier 1.5)
# XRLENV_BENCHMARK_CACHE (cache ROOT) still comes from the env / .env.

# Tasks NOT in the green set. Excluding them by-id (rather than an include-list)
# means new gateable tasks are picked up automatically after a re-populate.
# 12 tasks ship a solve.sh after the patch stage (11 upstream + notebook-compression's
# xrlenv-authored solution, see below); 5 are excluded here (4 GPU + 1 defect) →
# green set of 7. See STATUS.md for the full evidence. (The other 5 corpus tasks ship
# NO solve.sh, so they are never discovered.)
#
# Two of the 6 green come from curated patches/ overlays, NOT an upstream reference:
#  • dependent-type-checker — a G1 defect FIXED faithfully: its oracle read
#    /tests/reference_impl at solve time; the overlay bundles the byte-identical
#    UPSTREAM reference under solution/ (an oracle, just re-pathed). Confirmed reward 1.0005.
#  • notebook-compression — upstream withholds the reference, so this is an
#    xrlenv-AUTHORED solution (a lossless lzma compressor as the task's /app/run),
#    NOT an upstream oracle. Confirmed on-cluster reward 0.3175 (lossless, 80 files).
# Both are loudly labelled in patches/ and broken out in STATUS.md so the 5 upstream
# oracles are never conflated with the 1 authored solution.
EXCLUDE=(
  # 🖥️  GPU (gpus=1 in task.toml) — the dev cluster is CPU-only, so the oracle can't
  # even schedule. Not a broken oracle; revisit if GPU nodes are added.

  # 🧩 UPSTREAM oracle-content defect (G1 evidence in STATUS.md) — NOT an xrlenv/gate
