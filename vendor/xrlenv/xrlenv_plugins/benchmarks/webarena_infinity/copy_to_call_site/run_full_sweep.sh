# WebArena-Infinity — the full real-tasks sweep, run FROM the WAI checkout.
#
# WAI is an OUTLIER benchmark (GUIDELINE §7.2, runner-shim pattern): the eval runs
# from inside the WAI checkout (the "call site"), because the integration scripts
# import WAI's own evaluation/ modules and drive an in-container agent+verifier loop.
# So this entrypoint ships in copy_to_call_site/ and runs FROM the WAI checkout —
# after the two host-side prep steps are done (README §"Run an eval, end to end"):
#
#   # 1) (host, once per image change) build + push the answer-free substrate:
#   deploy/registry/build_and_push_images.py --plan .../webarena_infinity/build_plan.yaml --force
#   # 2) stage this payload into the WAI checkout's evaluation/:
#   cp .../webarena_infinity/copy_to_call_site/* <WAI-Repo>/evaluation/
#   # 3) run the FULL real-tasks sweep from the checkout:
#   bash <WAI-Repo>/evaluation/run_full_sweep.sh
#
# The build+push (step 1) is the separate image-prep phase (host-side; the Dockerfile
# + build_plan.yaml live at this benchmark's top level) — deliberately NOT in here, the
# same way golden-path `xrlenv build apply` is separate from run_full_sweep.sh.
#
# DEFAULT = the OFFICIAL 10-app real-tasks set (the paper figure "Performance of
# Browser-use Agents"; ~1260 real-tasks) — the exact apps in coding-bench
# configs/test_wai_monet_full_real-tasks.yaml. MODEL defaults to `oracle` — the
# browserless answer-injection gate (no LLM/creds) that validates the pipeline + every
# task's verifier end-to-end. Set APPS=all for the full 13-app HF corpus (1620 tasks).
#
# SCHEDULING: the underlying runner (run_eval_parallel_xrlenv.py) takes ONE --web-app, so
# this loops the apps **sequentially** (parallel WITHIN an app via --workers; workers idle
# at app boundaries). This differs from coding-bench's real monet eval, which uses a single
# **global app-ordered queue** (parallelism N across ALL tasks) via `runner.run` — use that
# config for the efficient leaderboard run. Sequential is fine for the oracle gate.
#
# Env knobs:
#   MODEL      default oracle        # or gpt / gemini-pro / … (a real agent needs LLM keys in .env)
#   TASK_SUITE default real-tasks    # or function-tasks / all
#   WORKERS    default 8             # containers in flight cluster-wide (per app)
#   APPS       unset                 # "all" = every app with the suite (13); or an explicit
#                                    #   space-separated list, e.g. "apps/gmail apps/xero-invoicing"
#   WEB_APP    unset                 # restrict to ONE app, e.g. apps/gmail
# Extra args are forwarded to run_eval_parallel_xrlenv.py. The WAI repo .env supplies
# XRLENV_GRPC_HOST + XRLENV_CONSUMER_TOKEN + XRLENV_PRIVATE_REGISTRY_HOST/_PORT + LLM keys.
