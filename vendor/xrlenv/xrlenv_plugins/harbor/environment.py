"""harbor ``BaseEnvironment`` adapter for xrlenv.

We subclass :class:`harbor.environments.docker.docker.DockerEnvironment`
rather than :class:`harbor.BaseEnvironment` directly, so the heavy
lifting harbor already does (docker compose orchestration, mounts,
env-var resolution, agent/verifier dir wiring, network policy,
keep-containers semantics, the ``preflight`` daemon check) is
inherited. We add:

- A constructor that accepts xrlenv-specific kwargs
  (``xrlenv_task_key``, ``xrlenv_group_id``, ``xrlenv_resources``,
  ``xrlenv_image_pin_mode``) without breaking harbor's signature.
  Today's LocalDocker mode records them on the instance; cluster
  mode (next slice) feeds them to the scheduler at the per-task
  invocation point.

- A subclass hook (``_xrlenv_route_command``) the cluster-mode
  follow-on overrides to redirect harbor's ``docker``/``docker
  compose`` invocations through xrlenv's gRPC stack to a
  scheduler-chosen node. LocalDocker mode is a pass-through:
  harbor's CLI calls run against whatever ``DOCKER_HOST`` resolves
  to (the local daemon by default), unchanged.

The architectural shape mirrors :class:`xrlenv.compat.docker_client.
XrlenvDockerClient`: subclass the upstream class, swap behavior at
specific seams, leave everything else inherited. The trade-off
documented over there applies here too — for arbitrary upstream
harness behavior we don't have to enumerate, inheritance keeps the
contract intact for free.

Why this lives in ``xrlenv_plugins/harbor/`` rather than
``xrlenv/compat/``:

- ``xrlenv.compat.docker_client`` adapts the *universal* Python
  Docker SDK; one shim serves every consumer that ever uses Docker
  via Python.
- This module adapts *one* RL framework's ``BaseEnvironment``
  Protocol; the next RL framework needs its own adapter (different
  Protocol, different methods). Per-framework plug-ins live under
  ``xrlenv_plugins/`` so xrlenv core doesn't accumulate
  framework-specific maintenance debt as the ecosystem grows.

See the package README for the canonical pattern other frameworks'
plug-ins should follow.

class XrlenvHarborEnvironment(DockerEnvironment):
    """harbor ``BaseEnvironment`` whose container ops can be routed
    through xrlenv when the consumer opts in.

    Constructor accepts every kwarg ``DockerEnvironment`` does, plus:

    - ``xrlenv_task_key`` (str | None): anti-affinity grouping key.
      Cluster mode uses it to keep concurrent rollouts of the same
      task on different nodes when ``max_runs_per_task`` is set.
    - ``xrlenv_group_id`` (str | None): cancellation cohort. Cluster
      mode propagates a ``cancel_group`` to all containers sharing
      this id, so a stuck-cohort kill takes them all down together.
    - ``xrlenv_resources`` (ResourceSpec | None): scheduler input.
      Recorded on the instance for cluster-mode consumption; the
      cluster-mode follow-on feeds it to the bin-packer when
      picking a node. LocalDocker today doesn't apply it locally —
      harbor's own ``EnvironmentConfig`` (``cpus`` / ``memory_mb``)
      drives the local cgroup, so applying ours on top would
      double-cap. If the consumer wants tighter local limits, set
      them via harbor's ``EnvironmentConfig`` directly.
    - ``xrlenv_image_pin_mode``: spec-19 audit input. Recorded on
      the instance for observability; cluster mode threads it into
      the catalog's pin-resolver decision.
    - ``xrlenv_cap_add`` (list[str] | None): Linux capabilities to add
      to the task container (e.g. ``["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_ADMIN"]``).
    - ``xrlenv_devices`` (list[str] | None): host devices to expose
      (e.g. ``["/dev/loop0:/dev/loop0"]``).
    - ``xrlenv_privileged`` (bool): run the container ``--privileged``.

      These three are applied **only in cluster mode** (forwarded to
      ``acquire_container``); the control plane's ``KwargsPolicy`` is the
      gate — ``cap_add`` is allowed by default, ``privileged`` needs the
      operator's ``allow_privileged`` opt-in in ``nodes.yaml``. LocalDocker
      records but does not apply them (harbor's compose path owns the local
      daemon). Infra/sysadmin tasks that need ``NET_ADMIN`` (iptables),
      ``SYS_ADMIN`` (ip netns), or ``SYS_PTRACE`` (debuggers) set
      ``xrlenv_cap_add`` to run under the cluster without a privileged host.

    LocalDocker (today): the kwargs are recorded on the instance for
    observability; everything else flows through harbor's inherited
    docker-compose path against the local daemon. The class is a
    drop-in for harbor.DockerEnvironment with no behavior change.

    Cluster (next slice): override ``_xrlenv_route_command`` to
    redirect harbor's docker/docker-compose subprocess invocations
    through xrlenv's gRPC stack to a scheduler-chosen node. The
    seam is in place; the routing implementation lands when the
    cluster-mode ContainerControl ships.

      ``"on"``; default false) — TLS channel.

    **Image distribution (P1.7.C.1 staged):**

    Images are pre-built on each node via the per-benchmark build
    flow (e.g. ``xrlenv_plugins/benchmarks/terminal_bench_2_1/
    build_cache.py`` + ``build_plan_gen.py``). The image tag the cluster
    looks up is either ``task_env_config.docker_image`` (when the
    upstream task ships a prebuilt) or ``hb__<environment_name>``
    (the harbor convention). If the chosen node doesn't have the
    image, ``acquire_container`` fails fast with ``ImageNotFound``
    pointing at the build script.

    Real build-on-acquire (``HarborImageBuilder`` + acquire→build
    →re-acquire fallback) is **P1.7.C.2** — out of scope for this
    slice.

    **Single-service only (P1.7.C.1 staged):**

    Multi-service compose tasks (a few harbor tasks attach a ``db`` /
    ``redis`` helper) are out of scope for this slice. The four
    overridden methods (``start`` / ``stop`` / ``exec`` /
    ``{up,down}load_*``) all assume a single ``main`` service. The
    cluster ``acquire_container`` returns one container; multi-
    service support requires either multiple acquires + a private
    network, or compose-on-the-node-side, both deferred to a
    follow-on slice.

        The legacy ``is_mounted`` / ``can_disable_internet`` boolean
        properties are silently shadowed by ``DockerEnvironment``'s
        own ``capabilities`` override via MRO — so we have to
        override the new API directly. Without this, harbor's
        ``Verifier.verify`` reads ``capabilities.mounted=True`` from
        the parent and skips the post-test ``download_dir`` call,
        leaving the consumer's ``trial/verifier/`` empty and
        producing ``RewardFileNotFoundError``.

        - ``mounted=False``: cluster never bind-mounts host paths;
          consumer host ≠ node host. Forces harbor to use the
          post-trial download_dir branch.
        - ``disable_internet=True``: the cluster honors a task's
          ``network_mode="no-network"`` by acquiring its container with
          ``--network none`` (loopback-only — localhost still works,
          external internet blocked). The raw acquire path applies
          ``network_mode`` directly to ``docker run`` (see
          ``node/raw_container.py``), so this is real enforcement, not
          a silent downgrade. ``start`` (below) sets it from the task's
          resolved ``network_mode`` (see ``_network_mode_for_task``); the
          default ``public`` leaves the bridge (internet on) untouched.
        - ``docker_compose``: **True for a multi-service task**, else
          False. A task whose ``docker-compose.yaml`` declares more
          than one service routes through ``acquire_compose_project``
          (compose-on-the-node); a single-service / compose-less task
          keeps the raw ``acquire_container`` path. Computed from the
          task compose via ``_multi_service_compose`` (§4b).
        - ``disable_internet=True``: honored on the single-container
          path via post-install ``apply_egress``. **Caveat for a
          multi-service task:** ``apply_egress`` is not yet supported
          for compose projects (it would restrict only ``main`` and
          leave sidecars open, so it raises) — an *offline* compose
          task therefore fails loud at post-install egress until
          project-network egress lands. None of the onboarded compose
          tasks are offline; the capability stays truthful for the

        The faithful substrate for TerminalWorld's DooD (Docker-out-of-Docker)
        tasks: the task's own compose mounts the host ``/var/run/docker.sock``
        — insecure on a shared multi-tenant cluster, and the cluster acquire
        path drops host mounts anyway. Under ``sysbox-runc`` the container can
        run its OWN unprivileged dockerd (that is sysbox's purpose), which is
        how a real TerminalWorld VM provides docker (its init/systemd starts
        it). We never edit ``solve.sh`` — we only bring the daemon up the way
        the VM's boot would, then let the unchanged task run.

        The task image must ship a docker daemon (``docker.io`` / ``docker-ce``).
        A CLI-only DooD image (``docker-ce-cli`` only, relying on the host socket
        by design) has no ``dockerd`` to launch: without ``install_dockerd`` this
        fails loud with a clear message rather than an opaque ``Cannot connect to
        the Docker daemon``. ``install_dockerd`` (see ``XRLENV_INSTALL_DOCKERD``)
        installs the daemon first — ``apt-get install docker-ce containerd.io``
        from the image's already-configured docker repo (falling back to
        ``docker.io``), needs in-container network. dockerd is launched detached
        (it survives the exec by reparenting to the container's PID 1 — ``sleep
        infinity`` — kept alive because sysbox acquires skip tini); we then poll
        ``docker info`` until the daemon answers or ``timeout_s`` elapses.

        The socket is ``chmod 666``'d once the daemon is up so a task whose image
        drops to a **non-root** user (``USER …``) can still reach the nested
        daemon — dockerd creates ``/var/run/docker.sock`` root-owned ``0660``, so
        without this a non-root ``solve.sh`` gets ``permission denied ... docker
        API``. Safe in a single-tenant task container.

        ``legacy_store`` disables the containerd image store
        (``containerd-snapshotter: false``) so pushes produce docker schema2
        manifests instead of OCI — for tasks whose tooling only understands
        schema2 (see ``XRLENV_DOCKERD_LEGACY_STORE``). Written to

            min(base_sec, max_sec or inf) * (phase_multiplier or timeout_multiplier)

        with ``base_sec = override_timeout_sec or <task.toml> timeout_sec``. Both
        inputs are on disk before the environment starts: the task's ``task.toml``
        (``environment_dir`` is ``<task>/environment``) and the trial's
        ``config.json`` — written by ``Trial._init_result``, the FIRST statement of
        ``Trial.run``, so it always exists by the time an exec runs). Reading the
        real multipliers rather than assuming one is what makes this correct for
        ANY ``--timeout-multiplier``; a guess would under-size the deadline
        whenever the multiplier exceeded it, which is the very failure this method
        exists to prevent.

        **Drift risk, accepted deliberately.** This MIRRORS harbor's formula
        rather than calling it, because harbor never exposes the computed budget
        to the environment — it passes ``_agent_timeout_sec`` into the oracle
        agent's constructor and keeps ``_verifier_timeout_sec`` on the Trial. So a
        change to ``Trial._resolve_timeout_sec`` upstream leaves this stale. That
        is tolerable because of which DIRECTION it fails in: a stale mirror can
        only compute a budget that is too small, which is precisely the state
        before this method existed (a flat 1800 s), and
        ``_DEFAULT_EXEC_TIMEOUT_S`` still floors it — so the worst case is the old
        behaviour, never something worse. It can never over-run either, since
        harbor's ``wait_for`` cancels the exec at the real budget regardless of
        what we compute. Re-check this against ``trial.py`` when bumping the
        pinned harbor version; ``tests/test_exec_deadline.py`` pins the formula's
        four inputs (base, override, cap, multiplier precedence).

        Note ``config.json`` is written with ``exclude_defaults=True``, so a
        multiplier of 1.0 is absent from the file entirely — absent must mean 1.0,
