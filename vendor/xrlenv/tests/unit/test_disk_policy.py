"""Regression tests for the P1 disk-exclusion deadlock (notes/audit.md).

The control-plane scheduler and the node image cache independently make
disk decisions. If the cache maintains free disk at/below the
scheduler's placement-admit floor, a node the cache calls *healthy* is
simultaneously scheduler-*excluded* → gets no work → generates no
eviction pressure → stays pinned excluded forever (observed on
``aws-ip-10-0-7-8``, 2026-07-01: 24 GiB free / 4.8% on a 500 GiB disk,
connected but zero placements for hours).

``xrlenv.disk_policy`` is the single source of truth that both planes
consume, and the invariant these tests lock in is: **the cache keeps
free disk strictly ABOVE the scheduler's admit floor, on every disk
size** — so a cache-maintained node is always admittable.
