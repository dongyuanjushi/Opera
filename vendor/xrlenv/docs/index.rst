XRLEnv
======

XRLEnv runs containerized agent and evaluation workloads on local
machines or a small fleet of cloud VMs. Your code asks for an
isolated container, XRLEnv chooses a node, tracks lifecycle and
artifacts, and gives operators a single place to inspect what
happened.

Use it when you need Docker-backed sandboxes that are easier to run
at cluster scale than hand-rolled SSH scripts or one-off Docker
daemons. XRLEnv is not a trainer, model server, or benchmark grader:
it manages sandbox execution and leaves task logic in your code or
the upstream benchmark harness.

   .. container:: landing-card

      **Try one local container**

      Start with :doc:`getting_started/quickstart` to boot ``xrlenv
      up``, acquire one container, run ``exec``, and destroy it
      cleanly.

   .. container:: landing-card

      **Run existing Docker SDK code**

      If your harness already calls ``docker.from_env()``, use the
      :doc:`Docker SDK drop-in
      <build_with_xrlenv/work_with_xrlenv_managed_containers/docker_py_dropin>`.

   .. container:: landing-card

      **Use a framework/harness adapter**

      For Harbor-format workloads (terminal-bench-2, seta-env, …), use
      the :doc:`framework adapter
      <supported_benchmarks_and_harnesses/harbor_framework>` and keep
      the benchmark's own driver in charge.

   .. container:: landing-card

      **Build a custom workflow**

      For new async Python code, use
      :doc:`Client.acquire_container
      <build_with_xrlenv/work_with_xrlenv_managed_containers/direct_api>`
      directly.

   .. container:: landing-card

      **Operate a cluster**

      Read :doc:`deploy/index` for deployment shapes and
      :doc:`observability/index` for the admin panel, metrics, logs,
      and image capacity views.
