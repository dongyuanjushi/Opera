"""docker-py drop-in for xrlenv.

Goal: a consumer's existing benchmark code that starts with
``client = docker.from_env()`` (SWE-bench's harness, terminal-bench's
DockerComposeManager, OSWorld's provider, etc.) can swap one line —

.. code-block:: python

    -import docker
    -client = docker.from_env()
    +import xrlenv
    +client = xrlenv.from_env()                              # local
    +client = xrlenv.from_env(control=cluster_control)      # cluster

— and have every container created through that ``client`` actually
run on a fleet node the xrlenv scheduler picked, with the platform's
capacity / image-distribution / cancellation features applied
transparently.

Architecture: docker-py's high-level managers (``client.containers``,
``client.images``) delegate every operation to **low-level**
methods on ``docker.APIClient`` (``api.create_container``,
``api.start``, ``api.put_archive``, ``api.exec_create``,
``api.images``, etc.). Overriding those low-level methods means
the high-level managers Just Work for free — the consumer's
``client.containers.run(...)``, ``container.exec_run(...)``,
``client.images.pull(...)`` all route through xrlenv without
touching the manager classes.

How it works
============

``docker.DockerClient.__init__`` is literally::

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.api = APIClient(*args, **kwargs)

So we subclass ``DockerClient`` and assign our own ``self.api``. The
manager objects (``client.containers``, ``client.images``, etc.) are
inherited from docker-py unchanged — they all delegate to
``self.client.api.<wire-method>()``.

Two modes:

LocalDocker (spike, single-host)
--------------------------------

``XrlenvAPIClient`` calls ``super().__init__()`` with the same
env-based config ``docker.from_env()`` uses, so every method
docker-py's manager classes call works against the local Docker
daemon. There are no method overrides — the subclass exists to
*reserve the seam* for cluster mode without reimplementing
docker-py's API surface.

In LocalDocker mode there's nothing to route — one host, one
daemon. The point of this mode is consumer ergonomics: they don't
have to think about docker vs. xrlenv at all on a laptop, and
benchmark harnesses (SWE-bench, terminal-bench, OSWorld) drive the
client unmodified through every docker-py code path.

Cluster (next slice)
--------------------

``XrlenvAPIClient`` skips ``super().__init__()`` (no daemon to dial)
and intercepts every wire-level method, routing through xrlenv's
existing gRPC stack to a scheduler-chosen node-agent. That's where
the real value-add (capacity-aware placement, image distribution,
cancellation primitives) lives.

xrlenv-specific metadata (task_key, group_id, resources) will ride
on **Docker labels**, not custom kwargs — labels are the standard
extensibility hook docker-py forwards end-to-end without us having
to override the high-level manager classes. Consumers will pass
e.g. ``labels={"xrlenv.task_key": "bench/1"}`` to
``client.containers.run(...)``, and the cluster-mode APIClient will
read those at create time to drive the scheduler.

The ``ContainerControl`` Protocol is the seam — concrete
implementations are :class:`LocalDockerContainerControl` (this file)
and ``ClusterContainerControl`` (next slice).

    Why this exists: the docker-py drop-in is **synchronous** by

    async + holds loop-bound state (gRPC channels, asyncio.Queues,
    Futures). Naive ``asyncio.run(coro)`` in each sync override
    creates a fresh loop per call, which is incompatible with a
    Client whose state was bound to a different loop — gRPC's
    async stubs in particular crash with
    ``Future <...> attached to a different loop`` when awaited
    on a loop that didn't create them.

    Two construction modes:

    - **Owned** (``__init__(loop=None)``): spins up a dedicated
      background loop on a daemon thread. Used by the
      ``from_env(grpc_host=..., grpc_port=..., ...)`` connect-mode

      all of its internal state binds to it. Every drop-in call's
      coroutine dispatches via ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` to
      the same loop — no cross-loop hazards.

    - **Attached** (``__init__(loop=<existing>)``): reuses a loop
      the caller already runs (e.g. an embedded
      ``build_distributed_runtime`` whose Client was built on the
      caller's running loop). Useful when the sync drop-in code
      runs in ``asyncio.to_thread`` from inside that loop —
      ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` posts back to the original
      loop. The caller owns the loop; ``close()`` is a no-op.

        ``ClusterContainerControl`` keyed by container_id. Returns
        the docker-API-shaped dict ``{"Id": <container_id>}`` —
        the high-level ``client.containers`` manager wraps that
        into a ``Container`` object the harness uses.

        ``detach=True`` is the only mode raw acquire supports
        (containers are spawned with their CMD running in the
        background; the harness ``exec_run``s into them after).
        Non-detach container.run is a follow-up.

        ``queue_timeout_s`` (issue #18, cluster-mode only): how long
        the control-plane admission queue will hold this acquire
        waiting for cluster capacity before failing. ``None`` uses
        the server default (3600 s). This is a drop-in *extension*
        kwarg — not part of docker-py's ``create_container`` — so it
        is silently ignored in local-Docker mode (no admission
        queue there). Raise it when deliberately over-requesting
        concurrency against a small cluster.

        ``session_deadline_s`` (issue #18, cluster-mode only):
        wall-clock cap on the acquired container's lifetime. The
        control plane force-destroys it once the cap passes — a
        safety net against a consumer that dies without calling
        ``remove``. ``None`` uses the server default (4 h). Also a
        drop-in extension kwarg, silently ignored in local mode.

        ``acquire_timeout_s`` (issue #12 / #18, cluster-mode only):
        wire deadline for the acquire round trip, which covers the
        node-side image pull. ``None`` uses the server default
        (600 s). Raise it for large images on a contended cluster
        where a cold pull can exceed 600 s. Also a drop-in extension
        kwarg, silently ignored in local mode.

        All three extension kwargs can equivalently be passed as the
        reserved labels ``xrlenv.queue_timeout_s`` /
        ``xrlenv.session_deadline_s`` / ``xrlenv.acquire_timeout_s``
        — the label path survives docker-py's high-level
        ``containers.create`` / ``.run``, which reject unknown
        kwargs.

        ``**_unused``: docker-py's ``create_container`` takes
        many more kwargs (volumes, ports, network_mode, ...).
        Most don't make sense on a remote-daemon path; we
        silently swallow them in cluster mode rather than fail
        on each caller's full kwarg menu. P1.7.B follow-ups can

    # ── Image ops (P1.7.B operator-pre-pulled contract) ────────────────────
    #
    # In cluster mode the consumer's host is NOT where the
    # container runs — image presence is a per-node property.
    # The raw-container path's contract is "operator pre-pulls
    # images on every node before consumers acquire" (see
    # ``RawContainerManager._ensure_image_present`` — acquire
    # fast-fails with XRLEnvError if the chosen node lacks the
    # image).
    #
    # Given that contract, the docker-py image methods behave as
    # operator-trust no-ops:
    #
    # - ``inspect_image`` — return synthetic Image dict (the
    #   harness's "is this image local" probe always says yes;
    #   if the chosen node actually lacks it, ``acquire_container``
    #   surfaces the error fast).
    # - ``pull`` — log + return success. The image cache layer
    #   (P1.2 / P1.6) handles distribution at the operator's
    #   request, not here.
    # - ``images`` — return ``[]``. The consumer-side host has
    #   no docker images to enumerate (the daemon lives on
    #   nodes); harnesses use this for cleanup loops which
    #   become no-ops, harmless.
    # - ``remove_image`` — log + no-op. Image lifetime is owned
    #   by the per-node LRU cache; the consumer can't unilaterally
    #   evict a shared image.
    # - ``history`` — return ``[]``. swebench uses this for
    #   ``find_dependent_images`` cleanup; empty history yields
    #   no dependents to clean, also harmless.
    #
    # Callers wanting REAL per-node image management should use

        Why this is a meaningful answer rather than ``[]``: swebench's

        here is genuinely "still alive from this client's
        perspective." swebench's filter by ``run_id in name`` picks
        the relevant subset.

        Limitations:
        - Scope is per-client-instance. Containers another
          ``xrlenv.from_env(...)`` instance or a direct
          ``Client.acquire_container`` created aren't visible here.
        - All entries report ``State: running`` since we don't carry
          phase info on sessions; this is fine for swebench's
          run_id-in-name filter.
        - The ``filters`` / ``since`` / ``before`` etc. docker-API

    - ``XRLENV_GRPC_HOST`` (string) — control-plane host. **If
      unset, returns a LocalDocker-mode client** (same daemon
      ``docker.from_env()`` would dial), so a fresh checkout +
      laptop dev keeps working with zero env vars.
    - ``XRLENV_GRPC_PORT`` (int, default 50051).
    - ``XRLENV_CONSUMER_TOKEN`` (string) — bearer token from
      ``xrlenv tokens issue consumer``. Required when
      ``XRLENV_GRPC_HOST`` is set.
    - ``XRLENV_GRPC_SECURE`` (``"true"`` / ``"1"`` / ``"yes"``;
      default false) — TLS channel.

    Mirrors ``docker.from_env()``'s reading of ``DOCKER_HOST`` etc.
    The audience never touches the factory call site; the operator
    sets env vars at deploy time.

    **Connect mode (explicit kwargs)**: ``grpc_host=...`` etc. take
    precedence over env vars. Use this when wrapping logic that
    needs different config per-instance, but the typical
    audience-facing pattern is the no-arg form.

    **LocalDocker mode** (no env vars, no kwargs): functionally
    identical to ``docker.from_env()`` against the local daemon.

    **Caller-supplied Client / runner / control**: SDK-level
    escape hatches for tests + advanced consumers; not part of the
