"""P1.7.A.1 — Consumer-side ergonomic wrapper for raw container sessions.

The internal ``RawContainerCoordinator`` (control-plane side) and
the proto-level RPCs (``AcquireContainer`` / ``ContainerExec`` /
``DestroyContainer``) work fine on their own, but case-2/3 harnesses
calling them through ``Client`` need a more ergonomic surface:

- The session ties its own ``rollout_id`` + ``container_id`` so
  callers don't have to keep them in scope.
- ``__aenter__`` / ``__aexit__`` guarantee destroy on context exit
  even if the harness raises mid-evaluation.
- ``exec`` returns the raw bytes (stdout/stderr) so the harness can
  pipe them into its own logs / artifact archives without forcing
  a UTF-8 decode.

Use as an async context manager::

    async with await client.acquire_container(image="busybox:1") as session:
        result = await session.exec(["echo", "hi"], timeout_s=5.0)
        assert result.stdout == b"hi\\n"
    # destroy fires automatically on context exit

Or imperatively::

    session = await client.acquire_container(image="busybox:1")
    try:
        await session.exec(...)
    finally:
        await session.destroy()
