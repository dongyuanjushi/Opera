        Image distribution (P1.7.B.2): the cluster routes the
        acquire to a scheduler-picked node via image-affinity
        scoring (`Scheduler.place(image_present=...)`), the same
        algorithm case-1 uses. The chosen node runs
        ``ImageCacheManager.ensure_present(image)`` to pull / build /
        no-op as appropriate. **Operators no longer need to pre-pull
        images on every node before consumers acquire** — the cluster
        handles distribution, caching, and eviction. For closed-set
        batch workloads (e.g., the full SWE-bench Verified set),
        operators can optionally run ``xrlenv images plan --refs <file>``
        to FFD-bin-pack the cluster's image bytes upfront.

        Args:
            image: Image ref (tag or digest).
            command: Optional CMD override; empty = image default.
                swebench's harness uses ``["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]``
                so the container stays alive while ``exec_run`` does
                the actual work.
            name: Optional explicit container name (docker auto-names
                when unset). Useful for ``docker ps`` recognisability;
                platform identity is the returned ``container_id``.
            labels: Extra docker labels; merged on top of the
                platform's ``xrlenv.rollout_id`` +
                ``xrlenv.session_kind=raw`` reserved keys.
            environment: Container env vars (``docker -e``). Used by
                harnesses that configure the workload via env without
                baking it into the image (HF_TOKEN, GIT_AUTHOR, ...).
            task_key: Anti-affinity key for the scheduler. Spread
                parallel acquires for the same logical task across
                nodes by passing the same ``task_key``; the scheduler
                rejects nodes already running ``max_runs_per_task``
                rollouts with that key.
            ensure_image_present: defaults to True (the new UX). False
                opts back into the strict legacy contract — node
                refuses acquire if image isn't present locally. Pass
                False for deterministic-eval contexts that need "no
                surprise pulls during evaluation."
            userns_mode: ``"host"`` (default, existing behavior — the
                container runs with host UIDs even when the docker
                daemon has a ``userns-remap`` config) or ``"remap"``
                (opt in to the daemon's user-namespace remap; the
                container's UIDs are subordinate UIDs on the host).
                **Defense-in-depth**: if the container's processes
                escape (kernel bug, mount race, etc.), they land as
                an unprivileged subordinate UID on the host rather
                than host root.

                Requires daemon-level ``userns-remap`` configured in
                ``/etc/docker/daemon.json`` separately; xrlenv does
                not write that file. When the daemon has no remap
                configured, ``"remap"`` is a silent no-op (the
                daemon ignores the empty userns-mode override).
                Default ``"host"`` because lots of benchmark tasks
                need in-container root + write access to
                host-bind-mounted paths — opt in per-acquire when
                the task's image doesn't have that requirement.
            acquire_timeout_s (issue #12): wire-level deadline for
                the AcquireContainer round-trip. ``None`` uses the
                default 600 s (matches the node-side image-cache pull
                timeout, so a legitimate cold-pull surfaces as the
                node's "pull failed" rather than a wire timeout).
                Pass a larger value (e.g. 1800) when acquiring a
                known-huge image: SWE-bench Pro tags can be 5-15 GB
                and don't fit in 600 s on a slow link. Smaller values
                are accepted but rarely useful — they just trip the
                wire on legitimate work.
            queue_timeout_s (issue #18): how long the control-plane
                admission queue will hold this acquire waiting for
                cluster capacity before raising ``CapacityExhausted``.
                ``None`` uses the server default (3600 s). Raise it
                when deliberately over-requesting concurrency against
                a small cluster and you'd rather wait than fail;
                lower it when you want a fast failure signal that the
                cluster is saturated.
            session_deadline_s (issue #18): wall-clock cap on the
                acquired container's lifetime. The control plane
                force-destroys the container once the cap passes —
                a safety net so a consumer that dies mid-rollout
                (process killed, never reaching ``destroy``) can't
                leak the container and its capacity reservation.
                ``None`` uses the server default (a generous 4 h cap,
                well above any single grading task). Raise it for
                genuinely longer work.
            cpu_limit: Effective CPU limit (in cores) for the
                container, treated as a scheduling input — the cluster
                places the container on a node that can satisfy it.
                ``None`` uses the raw-container default budget. The
                docker-py drop-in derives this from the harness's
                ``host_config`` (``NanoCpus`` / ``CpuQuota``) so a
                benchmark that caps CPU in local Docker mode keeps
                that cap in cluster mode.
            mem_limit_bytes: Effective memory limit (bytes), same
                scheduling-input semantics as ``cpu_limit``. ``None``
                uses the raw-container default budget.
            cpu_isolation: CPU-isolation contract (P6). ``OFF`` (default)
                leaves CPU affinity to the OS; ``BEST_EFFORT`` pins the
                container onto disjoint whole cores when the node has spare
                capacity (scheduling-neutral — the legacy
                ``runtime_limits.cpu_pinning=True`` maps here); ``REQUIRED``
                additionally makes pinning a placement constraint (pin-or-fail;
                scheduling semantics land in a later P6 slice — currently
                treated as ``BEST_EFFORT`` end-to-end). The effective mode is
                derived once at the control-plane ingress from this field
                falling back to the ``cpu_pinning`` alias.
            runtime_limits: Container-shape limits (pids / shm / tmpfs /
                read-only rootfs) that do **not** affect scheduling.
                ``None`` applies no constraint (docker default). The
                docker-py drop-in derives this from the harness's
                ``host_config``.

        Args:
            compose_yaml: The **rewritten, image-ref-only** compose document —
                every service references a pullable image (no ``build:``). The
                caller (the benchmark plug-in) is responsible for pre-building +
                pushing per-service images and rewriting the document; the CP

                and rejects (never strips) a disallowed privileged / host-bind /

            images: Image refs to ensure-present on the node before ``up``
                (``main`` + every sidecar), so a cold node pulls them via the
                image cache rather than failing ``up``.
            footprint_cpu: Whole-stack CPU reserve (cores) — ``main``'s declared
                cpu plus a sidecar allowance. The scheduler places the project on
                a node that can satisfy it; the CP can't derive ``main``'s
                declared size, so it arrives here.
            footprint_mem_bytes: Whole-stack memory reserve (bytes), same

            main_service: The service the harness execs into; defaults to

            project_name: Optional explicit compose project name; ``None`` lets

                ``[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*``).

            group_id: Cancel-cohort tag, same semantics as elsewhere.
            labels: Extra docker labels; merged on top of the CP's reserved
                ``xrlenv.*`` keys (which the plug-in must not set itself).
            queue_timeout_s: Admission-queue wait bound before
