"""P1.7.A.1 + P1.7.B.2 — Control-plane fan-out for raw-container sessions.

Sits between the consumer-facing ``RolloutControlServicer`` (which
serves the AcquireContainer / ContainerExec / DestroyContainer
RPCs) and the per-node ``NodeTransport`` (which talks the spec-21
wire to the chosen node). Tracks ``rollout_id → (node, container_id,
container_name, image)`` so subsequent ContainerExec / Destroy can
route to the right node.

The per-rollout session map is in-memory, but it is **backed by durable
state**: every acquire persists the routing + lifecycle fields
(``container_id``, ``node_id``, ``deadline_at``,
``effective_resources_json``, ``container_runtime``, ``fleet_id``) on the
rollout's ``raw_rollouts`` row. A control-plane restart therefore does
**not** kill live work — on node reconnect the raw-GC reconciler drives
:meth:`RawContainerCoordinator.readopt` /
:meth:`~RawContainerCoordinator.readopt_compose_project`, which rebuild
the in-memory session from the row plus the reconnected transport, so
the consumer resumes exec/destroy against the same container. A
deployment that disables the reconciler cannot do this, and
``_require_raw_reconnect_capable`` rejects raw acquires there rather
than silently accruing un-reconcilable state.

P1.7.B.2 (2026-05-07): the previous first-available ``_pick_node``
stub is replaced by the standard placement flow — same
``Scheduler.place(image_present=..., preferred_home_node=...)``
case-1 uses, with the per-placement ``query_image`` fan-out from
:func:`xrlenv.control.image_presence.query_image_presence`. Raw
acquires now benefit from image-affinity scoring + (when an
operator has run ``xrlenv images plan``) FFD-recorded
``preferred_home`` rows from StateStore. See
``notes/p1-7-b-2-image-affinity-plan.md`` for the design doc.

           ``xrlenv images plan`` operator CLI).
        3. ``Scheduler.place(...)`` scores nodes by
           ``weighted_sum_score(R=2/3, I=1/3)`` and returns the
           winner. Same algorithm case-1 uses.
        4. Pre-flight ``query_image`` on the winner (D19 mirror) —
           clean error if scheduler's snapshot was stale.
        5. ``AcquireContainerCommand`` to the winner; node runs
           ``ImageCacheManager.ensure_present(image)`` to pull /
           build / no-op as appropriate.

        Args:
            image: image ref to acquire (registry tag or per-node-

        the decoupled-count symptom from the 2026-06-09 analysis (an

        A lost node is unreachable by definition, so its containers

        Wired in at runtime construction via
        :py:meth:`Scheduler.set_raw_session_provider`. Without this
        wiring, the scheduler would be blind to raw-container load
        (raw containers don't pass through ``state.list_sandboxes()``)
        and would silently over-place — see the leak-fix block in
        :py:meth:`acquire` for the commit/release lifecycle that keeps
        ``_pending`` honest during the brief in-flight window.

        Resource footprint comes from the effective ``ResourceSpec``
        stored on the session at acquire time — the same spec
        ``acquire`` passed to ``Scheduler.place`` — so the post-acquire
        load entry charges exactly what the placement decision did,
        including any harness CPU/memory override (P0a).

        **Fleet reservation (phase 1, opt-in — R1).** When ``self._fleets``
        is non-empty this becomes a two-loop *list transformation* — the
        scheduler's summation (``_gather_cluster_load`` / ``capacity``) is
        untouched; only the shape of the list changes:

        1. **Non-fleet sessions** (``fleet_id is None``) — one entry each,
           byte-for-byte the legacy behaviour.
        2. **Fleet members** (``fleet_id`` set + a live reservation) — their
           cpu + mem are covered exactly ONCE by their fleet's footprint entry
           (loop below), so per-member they emit only a **disk-only** entry.
           This is the one documented exception to member suppression: disk
           stays per-container so it isn't under-counted (spec 10). A member
           whose reservation has already been dropped (the brief last-member
           release window) falls through to the non-fleet branch — a
           conservative over-count, never a gap.
        3. **Open fleets** — exactly one footprint entry per reservation,
           carrying the DECLARED peak cpu + mem once (and the reservation's
           ``task_key``, so the fleet counts as one fairness unit).

        With ``self._fleets`` empty and every session ``fleet_id is None``,
        loop (1) is the current code verbatim and loops (2)/(3) add nothing —
        the returned list is identical to the pre-fleet function (the golden

          rolls the slot back on any later failure
          (``_release_fleet_member_locked``).
        - **overflow** (fleet reserved, but this container would exceed the
          footprint): the consumer's *actual* peak container concurrency
          exceeded its declared footprint — an unavoidable reality when the
          concurrency is dynamic and not perfectly predictable. Rather than
          hard-fail the acquire (which would break the consumer's task), the

          co-located wherever it fits, queued if the cluster is full), NOT drawn
          from the reservation and NOT suppressed in accounting. The reservation
          still *guarantees* the declared footprint's worth of slots; anything
          beyond it is best-effort. No slot reserved, no member added.
        - **opener** (fleet not reserved, footprint declared): marks the fleet
          *opening* so a second concurrent opener for the same id is rejected.
          The reservation itself is created by the caller only once the lead
          container is up (mirrors the register-before-commit discipline).

        Raises :class:`XRLEnvError` only for a structural error (companion
