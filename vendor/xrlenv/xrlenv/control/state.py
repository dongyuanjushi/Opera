"""StateStore Protocol + in-memory and sqlite implementations (spec 20).

Phase 0 keeps the schema small but consistent with the spec-20 shape so the
phase-1 redis migration is just a different backend behind the same Protocol.
Step bodies live in their own ``rollout_steps`` table (sqlite) / list (in-mem)
so a single step append is O(1) — task #12 then moves the body to disk-jsonl

        bound between the connection-close checkpoints.

        SQLite auto-checkpoints only *passively* at commit time (once the
        WAL passes ``wal_autocheckpoint`` frames), and a passive checkpoint
        cannot reclaim frames still pinned by an open reader. So a steady
        reader (the admin panel polling DB-backed tabs) alongside the
        control plane's steady write stream (per-heartbeat node mirrors +
        rollout-lifecycle rows) lets the WAL grow unbounded until the next
        process restart — the only other time it's checkpointed. A runaway
        51 GiB WAL on the shared filesystem was observed to stall the
        control-plane event loop badly enough to mass-mark every node lost.

        The checkpoint runs on a DEDICATED, short-lived connection — NOT the
        shared writer connection under ``self._lock``. A ``TRUNCATE`` of a
        large WAL (e.g. one inherited after an unclean shutdown, before the
        periodic checkpointer has had a chance to keep it small) can take
        many seconds on a network filesystem; holding ``self._lock`` for
        that long would block every heartbeat/rollout write behind it — the
        exact event-loop stall this checkpointer exists to prevent (audit
        residual, 2026-07-15). A separate connection lets SQLite's WAL
        protocol coordinate instead: the checkpoint folds what frames it can
        and returns ``busy`` (no truncation this round) if the writer/readers
        hold the WAL, WITHOUT ever blocking them. ``busy_timeout`` stays at
        the default 0 so a contended checkpoint returns immediately rather
        than waiting; the next tick retries. TRUNCATE still folds frames into
        the main DB even when it can't reset the file, so the WAL stays
        bounded under sustained write load.

        ``(0, 0, 0)`` if the store is already closed.

        - ``raw_rollouts`` — TERMINAL rows (released/cancelled/failed/reaped/
          capacity_rejected) whose ``COALESCE(finished_at, created_at)`` is older
          than ``raw_rollout_retention_days``. Active rows (acquiring/running) are
          never touched; on-disk rollout artifacts are GC'd separately by the
          run-dir janitor.

        A ``None`` window skips that table. Deletes run in ``batch_size`` chunks
        so a large first purge doesn't hold one long write lock (WAL keeps
        readers unblocked between batches). NOTE: this frees pages for REUSE — it
        does NOT shrink ``state.db`` on disk. Run ``VACUUM`` (``xrlenv db vacuum``)
        once to return the freed space to the filesystem.
