"""``build-plan.yaml`` schema — two shapes coexisting.

The original P1.6 shape was **benchmark-driven**: top-level
``benchmarks: list[BenchmarkBuildSpec]`` where each entry names a
manifest (``swebench-verified``, ``terminal-bench-2``) and a
selection (smoke / instances / all). Dispatch ran via the
benchmark's registered ``BenchmarkImageBuilder``. P1.7.D deleted
the in-tree builders, so the benchmark-driven path is dormant
(but kept for any external plug-in that still registers a
builder).

The P1.7.C.2 shape is **per-image-ref**: top-level
``entries: list[BuildEntry]`` where each entry describes one
image to materialize, with a ``context_source`` discriminated
union (``registry`` / ``git`` / ``tarball``). This shape is
benchmark-agnostic — the schema, RPC, and node-side handler
don't know about harbor / tb2 / swebench. Adapters and
per-benchmark generators emit YAML in this shape; the cluster
materializes whatever the YAML says.

Both shapes share top-level ``budget`` + ``replication`` knobs
and route through the same ``image_planner.plan_opportunistic_placements``
bin-packer.

Per-image-ref schema example::

    version: 1
    replication: 1
    budget:
      reserved_runtime_gb: 30
      buffer_gb: 10
    entries:
      - image_ref: alexgshaw/fix-git:20251031
        context_source: { type: registry }
        placement:
          preferred_home_count: 1
          size_hint_bytes: 1500000000
          size_hint_source: registry-probe

      - image_ref: hb__seta-task-0
        context_source:
          type: git
          repo: https://github.com/camel-ai/seta-env
          ref: main
          subdir: Harbor-Dataset/0/environment
          dockerfile: Dockerfile
        placement:
          preferred_home_count: 1
          size_hint_bytes: 4500000000
          size_hint_source: heuristic
        pinned: false                         # never evict if true
        priority: 0                            # higher = build first when budget tight

Benchmark-driven schema example (legacy, still supported)::

    version: 1
    replication: 1
    budget: { reserved_runtime_gb: 30, buffer_gb: 10 }
    benchmarks:
      - name: swebench-verified
        selection: { smoke: true }

Validator rejects mixing the two shapes — ``entries`` and
``benchmarks`` are mutually exclusive.

Decisions locked (2026-05-08 design pass):

- ``size_hint_source`` distinguishes ``registry-probe`` (accurate),
  ``cluster-reported`` (post-build authoritative), and ``heuristic``
  (estimated; bin-packer adds safety margin).
- ``plan_id`` content-addresses the canonicalised plan; re-applying
  the same YAML is a no-op.
- ``pinned: true`` flows through to ``ImageCacheManager.pin`` after
  successful build; pinned images skip eviction.
- Plan-apply does a pin-budget sanity check upfront — refuses to
  dispatch if total pinned bytes per node exceeds the per-node
  image-cache budget.
