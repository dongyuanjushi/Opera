"""RolloutCoordinator — drives the spec-02 startup pipeline (Slice 1).

The coordinator is the only place RL semantics live on the control plane side.
It walks each rollout through the canonical startup sequence (resolve →
ensure-images → create + capacity → init → setup → first obs), mediates each
``step`` call between the consumer SDK and the in-sandbox EnvAdapter, and
seals the trajectory at finish.

Slice 1 implements:
- start_rollout (resolve → create → setup → first obs)
- step
- finish (teardown → destroy → seal)
- cancel (teardown best-effort → destroy → seal partial)

Slices 2+ add: deadlines, idle TTL + heartbeat, idempotency on retry, group
primitives, capacity reservation, scheduler bin-packing.
